# Architecture Decision Record: Image Storage Optimization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The app will display numerous product images, which vary in size and resolution. Optimizing these images is crucial for performance and bandwidth usage, especially for users on limited data plans or slower connections.

## Decision

We will use Amazon S3 for image storage, with CloudFront as our CDN to deliver images efficiently across the globe. We'll implement image optimization techniques, including compression, resizing, and lazy loading, to enhance load times and user experience.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Reduces load times for product images, improving the overall user experience.
  - Decreases bandwidth usage, which is beneficial for both the server and the end-user.
  - Scalable storage solution that can grow with our appâ€™s user base and image data.

- **Cons:**
  - Involves additional complexity in setting up and maintaining the image optimization pipeline.
  - Costs associated with AWS services, which will vary based on usage and required storage.
