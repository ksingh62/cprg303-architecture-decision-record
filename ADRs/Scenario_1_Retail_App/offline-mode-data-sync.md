# Architecture Decision Record: Offline Mode Data Sync

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The requirement for allowing customers to browse products and view their order history without an internet connection necessitates an effective offline mode. This mode should also support data synchronization when the connection is restored.

## Decision

Implement offline capabilities using SQLite for local data storage, with Firebase as the backend for online data synchronization. This approach ensures data persistence on the device and seamless sync across user sessions.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhanced user experience by providing continuous access to essential features, regardless of internet connectivity.
  - Ensures data integrity and consistency across sessions with efficient synchronization mechanisms.

- **Cons:**
  - Requires careful management of data synchronization to avoid conflicts and ensure data accuracy.
  - Additional complexity in testing and developing sync logic.
