# Architecture Decision Record: Hybrid App Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The retail company requires a mobile app that supports both iOS and Android platforms to maximize market reach. The app must offer a seamless user experience, including offline capabilities and push notifications, without incurring excessive development and maintenance costs.

## Decision

We have decided to develop a hybrid mobile application using Flutter. This framework enables us to write a single codebase for both platforms Android and iOS, ensuring consistency in functionality and user experience. Flutter's robust set of widgets and tools allows for creating a highly responsive and visually appealing interface.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Cost-effective development and maintenance for both iOS and Android platforms.
  - Streamlined development process with a single codebase.
  - Flutter's widget-based architecture ensures a native-like performance and flexibility in UI design.

- **Cons:**
  - May encounter limitations for complex native functionality, requiring additional work to integrate native code.
  - Dependence on Flutter's ecosystem for third-party libraries and tools.
