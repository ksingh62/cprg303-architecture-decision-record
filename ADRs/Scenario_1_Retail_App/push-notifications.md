# Architecture Decision Record: Push Notifications

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To engage customers and keep them informed about order updates, new product arrivals, and exclusive offers, the app requires an efficient way to send push notifications.

## Decision

We decided to integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for handling push notifications across both iOS and Android platforms. FCM provides a reliable, cost-effective way to send notifications at scale.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Cross-platform support ensures no customer is left out, regardless of their device.
  - Real-time notifications can drive engagement and prompt users to return to the app.
  - FCM integration allows for targeted and behavior-based notifications, enhancing marketing efforts.

- **Cons:**
  - Dependency on external service (Firebase) and adherence to its limitations and pricing structure.
  - Requires handling of user permissions and potential opt-out scenarios, respecting user preferences and privacy concerns.
