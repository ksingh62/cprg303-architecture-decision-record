# Architecture Decision Record: Internationalization and Localization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With plans to expand the customer base internationally, the app must support multiple languages and adapt to various cultural preferences to ensure a wide and inclusive user reach.

## Decision

We will implement internationalization and localization using the Flutter Internationalization package. This allows for easy addition of new languages and localization of content, dates, and currencies.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhances the appâ€™s accessibility and appeal to a global audience, potentially increasing market share.
  - Supports inclusion and diversity by respecting cultural differences and preferences.
  - Can lead to increased user satisfaction and retention by providing a personalized experience for users from various backgrounds.

- **Cons:**

  - Requires ongoing maintenance to add new languages and keep translations up to date.
  - May introduce complexity in the development process, especially when dealing with right-to-left languages or culturally specific content.
  - Additional testing is required to ensure that localization does not affect the app's functionality or layout in unexpected ways.
