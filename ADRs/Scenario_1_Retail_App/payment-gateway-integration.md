# Architecture Decision Record: Payment Gateway Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The app needs to offer secure and convenient payment options to customers, requiring integration with reliable payment gateways that support various payment methods.

## Decision

After evaluating several options, we have chosen to integrate Stripe and PayPal as our primary payment gateways. These platforms are chosen for their wide acceptance, robust security measures, and ease of integration.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Supports a wide range of payment methods, enhancing customer convenience.
  - Both platforms have strong fraud detection and security protocols, building trust with users.
  - Simplifies the checkout process, potentially increasing conversion rates.

- **Cons:**
  - Integration and transaction fees apply, which need to be considered in pricing strategies.
  - Requires compliance with PCI standards and additional security considerations.
