# Architecture Decision Record: Native App Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To provide an optimal user experience with high performance and access to device-native features such as GPS for location tracking, the food ordering app requires a development approach that leverages the full capabilities of the users' devices.

## Decision

We have decided to pursue native app development for both iOS and Android platforms. This decision allows us to tailor the app's performance and user experience to the specific capabilities and design guidelines of each platform.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhanced performance and smoother user experience by leveraging device-specific hardware and software capabilities.
  - Better integration with device-native features like GPS, camera, and push notifications.
  - Higher reliability and responsiveness, crucial for food ordering and delivery tracking functionalities.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Increased development and maintenance costs due to separate codebases for iOS and Android.
  - Longer development time as each platform requires its development lifecycle.
