# Architecture Decision Record: Menu Data Synchronization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ensuring that the app displays accurate and up-to-date restaurant menus requires efficient synchronization between the restaurants' inventory management systems and the app.

## Decision

The app will utilize a combination of RESTful APIs and webhooks to synchronize menu data with participating restaurants' inventory systems. This approach allows for real-time updates and minimizes the risk of displaying outdated menu items or prices.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Real-time menu updates improve customer satisfaction by providing accurate information.
  - Reduces order errors related to outdated menu items or prices.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Requires cooperation and technical integration with each restaurant's inventory management system.
  - Potential challenges in managing the consistency and reliability of data across diverse systems.
