# Architecture Decision Record: User Reviews and Ratings

## Status

Accepted

## Context

User reviews and ratings are crucial for building trust and guiding customer choices. The app needs a system for collecting, displaying, and moderating user-generated content.

## Decision

We will implement a feature within the app that allows users to leave reviews and ratings for restaurants and specific food items. This system will include moderation capabilities to prevent abuse and ensure the integrity of the feedback.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhances the decision-making process for users by providing insights from fellow customers.
  - Encourages restaurants to maintain high standards of quality and service.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Moderation of reviews requires resources to manage and can be challenging to balance fairness and freedom of speech.
  - Risk of fraudulent or biased reviews affecting restaurant reputations.
