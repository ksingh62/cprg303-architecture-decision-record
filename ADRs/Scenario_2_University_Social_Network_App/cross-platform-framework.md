# Architecture Decision Record: Cross-Platform Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The university social networking app needs to be accessible by both iOS and Android users to ensure widespread adoption and usability. The development and maintenance efficiency across multiple platforms is a priority.

## Decision

We have decided to use Flutter as our cross-platform framework for developing the university social networking app. This decision is based on Flutter's ability to deliver a native-like experience across both iOS and Android platforms from a single codebase.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Rapid development with a single codebase reduces development time and costs.
  - High performance that is almost indistinguishable from native apps.
  - Rich set of fully customizable widgets to create a native-like UI.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Flutter apps can be larger in size compared to native apps, potentially affecting download times and device storage.
  - The need for a Dart-specific development team or training for existing developers.
