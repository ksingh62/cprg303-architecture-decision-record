# Architecture Decision Record: Accessibility Features

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ensuring the app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is essential for inclusivity and legal compliance. Features such as text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and support for assistive technologies must be considered.

## Decision

Adopt accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) as a core part of the UI/UX design process. Implement features like text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and ensure compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Makes the app usable for a wider audience, including users with disabilities.
  - Demonstrates commitment to inclusivity and compliance with accessibility laws.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Requires additional design and development effort to implement and test accessibility features.
  - Ongoing need to update and maintain accessibility features as new guidelines and technologies emerge.
