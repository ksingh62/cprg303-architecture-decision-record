# Architecture Decision Record: Offline Mode Support

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To enhance accessibility and usability, especially in areas with poor internet connectivity or for users with limited data plans, the app requires robust offline functionality.

## Decision

Implement offline mode support using SQLite for local data storage and synchronization mechanisms to ensure users can access class information, events, and personal schedules without an active internet connection.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Ensures app usability regardless of internet connectivity, improving user satisfaction.
  - Reduces data usage for users, important for those with limited data plans.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Complexity in implementing synchronization logic to ensure data consistency between local storage and server.
  - Additional effort required for testing and maintenance of offline features.
