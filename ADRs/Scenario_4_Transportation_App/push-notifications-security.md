# Architecture Decision Record: Push Notifications and Security

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Push notifications are essential for keeping users informed about ride status, promotions, and updates. Ensuring the security of the notification system is paramount to protect user data and privacy.

## Decision

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) will be used for push notifications due to its robust, secure, and platform-agnostic service. Additionally, all communication and data handling will adhere to best practices for security, including the use of HTTPS and encryption for data in transit and at rest.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Reliable delivery of notifications across platforms.
  - Enhanced security measures protect user information and app integrity.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Dependency on Firebase for critical communication features.
  - Requires continuous monitoring and updates to maintain security standards.
