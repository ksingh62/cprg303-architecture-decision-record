# Architecture Decision Record: Database Schema Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A well-designed database schema is crucial for storing and retrieving data efficiently in the transportation app. The schema must support user profiles, ride history, and payment information securely and scalably.

## Decision

We will use a relational database management system (RDBMS), specifically PostgreSQL, for our database needs. The schema will be designed to optimize data integrity, query performance, and scalability.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Strong data integrity and relationship enforcement with RDBMS.
  - Scalable and secure storage for sensitive user and transaction data.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Requires careful planning and design to avoid performance bottlenecks as the app scales.
  - Management and maintenance of the database system increase with complexity.
