# Architecture Decision Record: Real-Time Tracking

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For a transportation app, offering real-time tracking of rides is essential for both drivers and passengers to see live locations and ETA updates. Implementing an efficient real-time system is crucial.

## Decision

We will use WebSocket technology to implement real-time tracking. This allows for a persistent connection between the app and server, enabling instant data updates and communication.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Provides a seamless and responsive real-time tracking experience.
  - Reduces latency compared to traditional polling methods.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Requires careful handling of connections and server load to ensure scalability.
  - Increased complexity in backend infrastructure to manage persistent connections.
