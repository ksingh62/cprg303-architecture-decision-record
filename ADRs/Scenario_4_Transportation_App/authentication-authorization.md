# Architecture Decision Record: Authentication and Authorization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ensuring secure access to the app and appropriate user permissions is fundamental. This involves implementing a reliable system for user authentication and authorization.

## Decision

Firebase Authentication will be used for managing user authentication. It supports various login methods, including email/password, social media accounts, and phone authentication, providing flexibility and security.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Simplifies authentication process with support for multiple login methods.
  - Integrates easily with other Firebase services for a cohesive development experience.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Reliance on Firebase as a central part of the app's security infrastructure.
  - Potential limitations if custom authentication flows are required.
